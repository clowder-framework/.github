## Clowder - a data mangement framework for research 👋

[Clowder](https://clowderframework.org/) is a cloud native data management framework to support any research domain. 
Clowder was developed to help researchers and scientists in data intensive domains manage raw data, complex metadata, and automatic data pipelines.

Clowder is not a central system, but software that research labs and individual users can install on local clusters or in the cloud. 
Clowder is data agnostic, but can be customized for specific data types through a sophisticated information extraction bus and web based visualization plugins.

Clowder is also a community of practitioners working on data intensive research projects and developing tools that work across research domains.

The first version of Clowder ([v1](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder)) has been in development for over ten years and it has been used in various [domains](https://clowderframework.org/projects.html). 
A new version of Clowder, [v2](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder2) is currently in development. 
v2 builds on lessons learned from current and prior use cases and is being developed with two major goals in mind: 
- a modernized web interface for end users
- an easy to pickup and easy to maintain codebase 

We are always looking for new collaborators, contributors, and ideas in the space of research data management. 

- If you are interested in contributing to Clowder v2 please come say hi in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clowder-software/shared_invite/enQtMzQzOTg0Nzk3OTUzLTYwZDlkZDI0NGI4YmI0ZjE5MTZiYmZhZTIyNWE1YzM0NWMwMzIxODNhZTA1Y2E3MTQzOTg1YThiNzkwOWQwYWE)
- If you are ready to dive into the code, take a look at [good first issues](https://github.com/clowder-framework/clowder2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) in v2
- If you have a project where Clowder could be of help but you are not sure, [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clowder-software/shared_invite/enQtMzQzOTg0Nzk3OTUzLTYwZDlkZDI0NGI4YmI0ZjE5MTZiYmZhZTIyNWE1YzM0NWMwMzIxODNhZTA1Y2E3MTQzOTg1YThiNzkwOWQwYWE) is a also a great place to share your needs
